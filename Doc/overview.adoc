== Users roles

The general use case has been designed in such a way that there is an owner and a tenant. In this sense, during the realization of this one we found that there was no real actor in this application

In other words, the current application has no real user. These are just features developed with no real link yet.

We decided to give a goal to our app and to define clearly the users of it. +
Indeed, the current state of the application is not obvious: it is difficult to see who will use the app and the uses of it.  

So, we decided to clarify these points. +
First, let’s talk about the goal of the app. We will try to develop this app so that it will be used for long-term apartment’s rental. +
Users will be able to see the different apartments and to select them according to the most important criteria for them. That led us to the second point: for whom will be this app designed. +
We decided that the main users of this app will be the tenants. The apartment’s owner won’t interact with the app. To put the apartments online and eventually to modify them, we add a second actor in our model : a manager. +
The role of this actor is basically to put the apartments online, to modify them if needed and to delete them if a place is rented for example.


== Run - Executable classes

This section explains the different entry points of the application

We put this part in overview, because we think it can be interesting to see what the entry points of the application look like to start having more ideas on the general functioning of the application

[NOTE]
====
As mentioned above, this application currently has no real graphical interface. They are just small bricks.

We are concentrating our efforts on improving the project in general, the implementation of a graphical interface will be done in a second step

====

.Effective version
[%collapsible]
====
This function runs a GUI, which asks the user his criteria of selection for choosing an apartment. The user can input the minimum surface and the minimum number of bedrooms for example. The user can also choose which criteria is the most important between Wi-Fi and a terrace and between the television and the price per night.

This answer seems to order the apartment results but not efficiently. To display results, our function calls `LayoutApartmentGUI`.

The title of the GUI is “Votre avis nous intéresse” which could mislead the user by making him think that’s just an opinion pool.
====

.Improvement idea
[%collapsible]
====
For the moment, all questions are in French and unwell worded. One objective could be translating these sentences and reformulating them to precisely guide the user.

The preference function must also be improved in order to present the user more pertinent results.
====


=== LayoutApartmentGUI

.Effective version
[%collapsible]
====
This function runs a GUI, which displays all the apartments in the database. If you select an apartment in the list, multiple details are displayed:

* The address
* The surfaces
* The price
* The number of bedrooms
====

.Improvement idea
[%collapsible]
====
The field which displays details is too small to read them completely. A first improvement could be to enlarge them.

We could also add more details such as the number of bathrooms or if the apartment has Wi-Fi or television. In fact, we could add all the information we have on the apartment.
====

=== ModifyApartmentGUI

.Effective version
[%collapsible]
====
This class initialize an interface in order to modify an existing apartment. When the graphic interface has been launched, a window with the last apartment created pops up. We can then modify the diverse characteristics of the apartment such as the number of bedrooms... + 

This class belongs to the `apartments.gui` package and extends the class `FormApartmentGUI`. +
This class allows us to create the window we previously saw, to deal with several mistakes we could have and to save the created and modified apartments.
====

=== CreateApartmentGUI

.See usecase diagram
[%collapsible]
====
image::it3/it3-usecase-createapartment.png[Diagram create apartment]
====

.Effective version
[%collapsible]
====
Graphic interface which enables the user to create a new apartment. When this class is run, it launches a graphic interface with fields to fill in order to define the characteristics of the created apartment.

Three fields must be filled in order to create the apartment: the title (of the ad), the address and the floor to know where the apartment is located.

We can also add details to our ad such as:

* The number of bedrooms;
* The number of people who can sleep in the apartment;
* If the apartment has a terrace or no;
* The location of the terrace if existing (which floor);
* The price per night;
* The minimum number of nights the tenants have to stay in the house;
* If the apartment has Wi-Fi and television;
* A brief description.

Once the mandatory fields filled, the apartment is automatically saved and updated with the optional information in an XML file.

As we have the ambition to transform our software into a long-term apartment rental platform, some fields such as the minimum number of nights might be deleted in the next iterations.
====

.Improvement idea
[%collapsible]
====
In order to improve and make this window match with our ambitions, we might add or modify the following fields (non-exhaustive list):

* Improve the « design » of some error messages. Actually, some of them are cut and we can only see the beginning of the displayed message. 
* Add options. For example, we can add a field which indicates if the apartment is furnished or not or if the animals are allowed in the building.

This class belongs to the `apartments.gui`  package and extends the class `FormApartmentGUI`.
====

=== ReadTwoApartmentsTest

.Effective version
[%collapsible]
====
This class belongs to the `readapartments` package +
We are looking here to create instances of `Apartments` from resources (example: file)

`ReadTwoApartmentsTest` is a test code for reading apartments from an XML file.

There are two ways to retrieve information stored in an XML file:

1. Using a `FileInputStream`: Opens a connection to a real file (the name of the file is passed in parameters). +
This creates a `FileDescriptor` which represents the file in the application (pay attention to the exception `FileNotFound`)
2. Using `getResourceAsStream`: Allows you to search for a resource by name (pay attention to the exception `NullPointerException`)

In both cases, we use an `InputStream` because it is external resources. +
In this sense, we call a method of the class `ReadApartmentsXMLFormat` which converts the XML file into an `Apartment` object.
====

.Improvement idea
[%collapsible]
====
This class will evolve because the apartments are stored in XML format, and one of the needs is to migrate from XML format to JSON format
====
